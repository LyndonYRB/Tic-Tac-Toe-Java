# Tic-Tac-Toe-Java

##### Created by Lyndon St.Luce

A simple tic-tac-toe game made in Java.
You run the "TicTacToe.java" file to to start the game,
it'll ask you to pick a space ( pick a number between 1 and 9)
these are how the spaces are numbered:

1|2|3
-+-+-
4|5|6
-+-+-
7|8|9

and this is how the board will look at the start of the game:

| |
-+-+-
| |
-+-+-
| |

let's say you pick space "1" it'll will look like this:

X| |
-+-+-
| |
-+-+-
| |

the computer will randomly pick any other space like this:

X| |
-+-+-
|O|
-+-+-
| |

make sure you type 1-9 and amke sure the space is not occupied otherwise you'll get a
"`<insert number>` is not a valid move!" HAVE FUN!

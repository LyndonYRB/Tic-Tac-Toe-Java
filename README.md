# Tic-Tac-Toe-Java

##### Created by Lyndon St.Luce

A simple tic-tac-toe game made in Java.
You run the "TicTacToe.java" file to to start the game,
it'll ask you to pick a space ( pick a number between 1 and 9,
1 being the top left to 9 being the buttom right)

make sure you type 1-9 and make sure the space is not occupied otherwise you'll get a
"`<insert number>` is not a valid move!" HAVE FUN!
